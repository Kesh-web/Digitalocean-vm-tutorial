This is an Arch Linux Setup on DigitalOcean using cloud-init and doctl.

What is Digital Ocean?
Digitalocean is a cloud infrastructure provider that offers cloud computing services. It allows you to manage virtual private servers that they call "Droplets".

The purpose of a Droplet is to be able to operate indepedantly and it runs its own operating system. You would be able to install manage applications, databases, websites, and other services. 

Some examples of using a Droplet is to host websites, host services such as (email, file storage), and running databases.

With that in mind the importance of setting up a secure VPS (virtual private server) is extremely crutial. Imagine setting up a file storage with your sensitive information. Without proper security your data could be exposed. Another example is preventing unauthorized access by setting up SSH Keys (will be explaiend in section 1).
